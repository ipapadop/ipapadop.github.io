I am a software engineer at [AMD](https://www.amd.com). I am mostly interested in parallel and heterogeneous computing, a lot of C++, and a hint of Machine Learning.

I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), where I worked on the [STAPL](https://parasol-lab.gitlab.io/stapl-home/) Runtime System under the supervision of Dr. Lawrence Rauchwerger.
